   <p>There is no better way to understand Nepal and Nepali people, than through their cuisine. Nepal does not have one distinct cooking
     style. However,food habits differ depending on the region. Nepali food has been influenced by Indian and Tibetan styles of cooking.
      Authentic nepali taste is found in Newari and Thakali cuisines which are available in a large number of eateries spread all over
       the valley. Among the many options in Nepal’s tourism products, Nepali food can be considered heaven for culinary tourism. 
       The multi-ethnic and multi-cultural disposition of Nepal offers unlimited choice of cuisines based on region, religion, ethnicity, culture, festivals, environment and diverse climatic conditions</p>
<p>Wherever you go, your trip would be incomplete without getting an opportunity to taste the local cuisine. Nepal is the land of diverse 
    cuisine. The vast number of ethnic groups have their own delicacies depending on the topography and climate of their region. Rice is the major source 
    of energy in the country, Nepali people consume it two times a day, as lunch and dinner, on a daily basis. However, 
    side dishes may vary from lentils to vegetable curry to meat curry to extremely spicy pickles and in the Himalayan region their meals are completely different.</p>
    <p>Nepali food is classified as (a) Madhesi comprising of Maithili, Bhojpuri, Awadhi and Lohorung indigenous to the Eastern Nepal region (b) 
        Janajati cuisine in the middle hills (c) Urbanized Newari cuisine from Kathmandu Valley (d) Thakali cuisine from the Himalayan lowland and (e) Himalayan 
        cuisine, culturally close to trans Himalayan and Tibetan ethnic groups. The wealth of the Nepali food needs to be explored, analyzed and
         tasted to learn more about the country. </p><br>
